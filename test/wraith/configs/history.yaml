# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'history' mode, which is best suited to
# making sure your site's appearance remains consistent over
# time.
#
# `wraith history history.yaml` # generate base screenshots
# `wraith latest history.yaml`  # take new shots and compare

# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
