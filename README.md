# Government Frontend

Government Frontend is a public-facing app to display the majority of documents on the /government part of GOV.UK, which are fetched from the [Content Store](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store). It is a replacement for the public-facing parts of the [Whitehall](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall) application.

## Schemas

Not all schemas that this app can handle are rendered by it in production.
